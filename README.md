# App-todo

A simple CURD (create, read, update, delete) application to understand the basics of NodeJs and to get a basic understanding that how a real world Web Development Project may look like.

Build a ToDO application that allows us to create to-do list items, list all items , update them and delete them, all on the front end.

# Data Storage

Basically, we have to store our ToDO application data so we can store in the database but for this project we have stored them in our Javascript Object. Seed.Js contains records and each record has following attributes: id , title , Status.

# App Structure

Our app should consist of one HTML file (index.html), one stylesheet file (style.css) and three JavaScript files, one that contains your app code (script.js) and one that contains the initial state of your "database" (seed-data.js) and one from which (index.js) HTTP sserver runs.
